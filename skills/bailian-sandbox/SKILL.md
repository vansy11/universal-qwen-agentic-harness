# Bailian Sandbox (`bl sandbox`)

Before running `bl`, read the shared [bailian-protocol](../bailian-protocol/SKILL.md) for consent, high-risk confirmation, version checks, authentication, and error handling. If it is missing, stop execution and prompt the user to install the full family with `bl skill init`.

## Scope and setup

- Manage Sandbox instances and templates through Bailian's E2B-compatible REST control plane. No E2B SDK or E2B API key is required; authentication uses the Bailian API Key as an Authorization Bearer token.
- Resolve Base URL through the same CLI chain as Managed Agent: `--base-url` > `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL` > login/profile `base_url`. Use an origin such as `https://workspace.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com`; the CLI strips URL paths/query/fragment and appends `/api/v1/agentstudio/sandbox` for lifecycle operations, or `/api/v1/agentstudio/files` for template file uploads. The saved API Key is reused. Profile capability fallback follows the shared protocol for both the key and Base URL.
- If no Base URL is configured, resolve the workspace from `--workspace-id`, then `BAILIAN_WORKSPACE_ID`, then configured `workspace_id`, and use `https://{workspace_id}.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/api/v1/agentstudio/sandbox`. With a configured Base URL, the workspace flag is optional. The service currently supports `cn-beijing` and requires prior Sandbox SLR authorization.
- No `agents.yaml` or local IaC state is required. `get` / `connect` return instance connection information; neither opens an interactive shell or browser. For WebShell, CDP, or VNC, use that information with the runtime APIs described below. Do not invent `bl sandbox exec`, `webshell`, or browser subcommands.

## Choose the operation

| User intent                             | Command family                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discover built-in base image presets    | `bl sandbox official-images` (offline, no authentication) |
| Upload a local file for template mounts | `bl sandbox file upload`                                  |
| Inspect or create instances             | `bl sandbox list` / `get` / `create`                      |
| Connect, pause, or resume an instance   | `bl sandbox connect` / `pause` / `resume`                 |
| Release an instance                     | `bl sandbox delete`                                       |
| Inspect or build templates              | `bl sandbox template list` / `get` / `create` / `update`  |
| Check a submitted template build        | `bl sandbox template build-status`                        |
| Delete a template                       | `bl sandbox template delete`                              |

Read [reference/index.md](reference/index.md) and the relevant section of [reference/sandbox.md](reference/sandbox.md) for exact flags, usage, and examples, or run the matching command with `--help`. Do not guess flags.

To save the origin in an isolated Profile, use `bl auth login --config sandbox --api-key <key> --base-url <origin>`. For a one-command override, use `bl sandbox list --base-url <origin>`. Custom gateways also apply to template build-status polling.

For built-in template images, discover the preset ID or Chinese name through `sandbox official-images`, then pass it to template create/update with `--image`. This fills both `fromImage` and `imageName`; `--image-name` alone remains a display name, not an image selector. Presets override the body's image fields; explicit `--from-image` / `--image-name` override the corresponding preset fields. Presets are pinned cn-beijing image URLs, not a live catalog or an availability guarantee for other environments. Omitting `--image` does not change existing defaults or update a template's image implicitly. See the generated reference for the catalog and exact flags.

## Connect to an instance

For requests to access a running instance, open WebShell, control a browser, or show its live desktop, read [assets/instance-connections.md](assets/instance-connections.md). It contains the connection workflow, API payloads, verification steps, and official documentation links.

- Obtain fresh JSON with `bl sandbox get --sandbox-id <id> --show-credentials --output json`. Use `envdAccessToken` as `X-Access-Token`; the control-plane Bailian API Key is a different credential.
- WebShell uses the returned `envdUrl` and envd PTY RPCs. The official browser template uses port 3000 on `{port}-{sandboxID}.{domain}` for CDP and VNC. These ports and paths come from the template contract, not fields returned by `get`; do not apply them to other images without checking their documentation.
- When the user asks to open or access the instance, complete the connection and verify a terminal command or rendered browser page. Returning connection JSON or a successful health check alone does not complete that request. A local proxy URL is a host-side access page, not a URL returned by the Sandbox API.

## Operational boundaries

- Mutating commands act on remote resources. Only perform the requested operation and scope; read-only discovery does not authorize creating, pausing, resuming, or deleting resources.
- Instance and template deletion are high-risk. Follow the shared protocol: show the exact target and risk, then wait for explicit confirmation before adding `--yes`. Treat `requires_confirmation` as a stop signal, not a reason to retry automatically.
- Connection credentials are redacted by default. A request to connect to or access the instance needs the tokens: use `--show-credentials` for that operation, capture the result privately, and keep tokens out of chat summaries, logs, URLs, and committed files.
- Template create/update wait by polling the build-status endpoint, not template details. `--async` returns after the submission response with `templateID` / `buildID`; it does not mean the build is ready. Use those IDs with `template build-status` to check completion.
- Global `--timeout` limits HTTP requests and total template-build polling. `--instance-timeout` sets instance lifetime; these are different limits. A polling timeout does not prove the remote build failed or stopped; check its status before submitting another build.
- `--body` accepts a JSON object inline or through `@path`; explicit flags override body fields. For local template mounts, first use `bl sandbox file upload`: it sends multipart `file` and fixed `source=sandbox_template` directly to `/api/v1/agentstudio/files` with the Bailian API Key. Use the returned `id` as `mntConfig[].originFileId`, with `mountPath` and optional `originFileName`, in template create/update `--body`. The upload and template must use the same workspace. This is not the temporary OSS upload from `bl file upload` or a transfer into a running instance.
- File upload returns immediately after the upload response and does not poll security review. `status=checking` is not ready to mount; only use files whose status is `available`. `--quiet` returns the File ID only; inspect the normal/JSON response for status. Upload alone does not authorize creating a template or instance.

## Common hand-offs

Refer to sibling skills by name: read them if installed; otherwise use the command's `--help` or prompt `bl skill init`.

- Managed Agent / Session / Environment resources or `agents.yaml` IaC → `bailian-managed-agent` (`bl managed-agent --help`).
- Workspace discovery or CLI login/configuration → `bailian-cli` (`bl workspace --help` / `bl auth --help` / `bl config --help`).
